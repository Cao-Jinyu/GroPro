## Overview

The aim of this project is to design and fabricate a prototype adaptive lighting system for optimising plant growth. 
It provides improved usability over standard lighting systems that are currently available, as the user can control and 
monitor the device from an Android phone application or not interact with device at all during operation. This is due to its 
real-time auto-adjustment protocol. The project is completed in association with the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) and is an exercise to gain experience with real-time embedded programming.

You can follow the project's progress, interact with the developers and put forward your ideas for improvements through our social media pages linked above. Take a look through the Wiki for a detailed explanation on all elements of the project. All relevent files are in this Github repository.
